# COLLABORATIVE-FILTERING-UTILIZING-NEURAL-NETWORKS
In this work, I will get into RS’s operation, hardships, and how Machine Learning(ML),
and specifically Neural Networks(ΝΝ), can be applied in such systems. To specify, this the-
sis attempts to integrate two different networks based on the Neural Collaborative Filtering
(NCF) framework. On one hand, a Matrix Factorization (MF) network is used and on the other
two different NNs, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
Eventually, after experiments on two different datasets, it is certain that the models have sim-
ilar scores with LSTM having slightly more accurate results. In detail, firstly we have used
the ”Book-Crossing” dataset and secondly data from AMiner Citation Network.
